# About this Workshop

## Introduction to Oracle Database@AWS

Oracle Database@AWS is an offering that allows Oracle and AWS customers to migrate Oracle Databases, including Oracle Exadata workloads, to Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure and Oracle Autonomous Database Service on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure within AWS. 

Customers can easily and quickly migrate their workloads with minimal or no database or application changes. Oracle Database@AWS allows you to unify Oracle and AWS data using zero-ETL integrations for access to AWS generative AI, machine learning, and analytics services. You can also benefit from simplified management and operations.

When you implement this solution, you deploy resources in two cloud environments: database resources are in AWS, while the database administration control plane is in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This lets you deploy Oracle Database products in your AWS environment while OCI maintains the administration capabilities.

## Workshop Objectives

This hands-on workshop provides users with step-by-step instructions on provisioning Oracle Exadata Database@AWS. It provides detailed technical steps about pre-requisites steps and preparation needed for creating an Oracle Exadata infrastructure and Oracle Exadata VM Cluster and then create CDBs and PDBs. 

Oracle Exadata Database @AWS helps to run Oracle Database natively in AWS with the highest levels of performance, availability, security, and cost-effectiveness available in the cloud.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 Hours 30 Minutes

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Step 1. Create VPC and ODB Network
* Step 2. Create ODB peering connection
* Step 3. Create Oracle Exadata Infrastructure through AWS Console
* Step 4. Create Oracle Exadata VM Cluster through AWS Console
* Step 5. Create Oracle Database on an Exadata Database Service@AWS
* Step 6. Connect to Oracle Database@AWS


## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful
* Basic knowledge about DB @AWS concepts is helpful
* Familiarity with Oracle  Exadata Database is helpful
* An existing AWS Cloud Account

If you do not have an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account, you can create one during your service deployment. If you do have an OCI account, you can use it with Oracle Database@AWS.
